        <h2>
            ICE challenges
        </h2>
       
        <p>
            These are some of the ICE challenges I worked on over the last few weeks. Click on each one to open the page in a new tab.

        <h2>
            Prophet Card
        </h2>
       
        <p>
            I was assigned to create a card showing the Prophet and some things about him. I learned about creating borders and basic styling.
        </p>

        <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="ice/apostle_spotlight/apostles.html">
        <h2>
            Apostle Spotlight
        </h2>
       
        <p>
            This assignment was to create a "spotlight" of sorts showcasing the Apostles. I learned about formatting images (and how picky CSS can really be about this)
        </p>

        <a href="ice/favorite_devo/favdevo.html" target="_blank" class="paragraph">
        <h2>
            Favorite Devo Table
        </h2>
       
        <p>
            We made a table showing our favorite devotional along with a placeholder form to submit one's own. I learned a lot about css and tables here.
        </p>

        <a href="ice/halloween/index.html" target="_blank" class="paragraph">
        <h2>
            Holiday Page
        </h2>
       
        <p>
            This one was a fun cahllenge where we were all given the same HTML and asked to each give our own CSS to it. I spent a lot of time learning how to make the "frosted glass" effect.
        </p>

        <a href="ice/grid_flags/flags.html" target="_blank" class="paragraph">
        <h2>
            Country Flags
        </h2>
       
        <p>
            Here I recreated flags using CSS grids. Quite an interesting activity. I learned how to add grid gaps here.
        </p>
        </a>
        <a href="ice/positioning/positioning.html" target="_blank" class="paragraph">
        <h2>
            CSS Positioning
        </h2>
       
        <p>
            This one got into some complex things regarding grids in CSS. The main takeaway I had from this one was getting overlap can be really easy if you do it right.
        </p>

        <a href="ice/gallery/gallery.html" target="_blank" class="paragraph">
        <h2>
            Image Gallery
        </h2>
       
        <p>
            This was a unique assignment. We were to optmize the images because the browser was loading 12 30MB images as thumbnails. I learned how to optimize images and create thumbnails.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Signup Form
        </h2>
       
        <p>
            I was tasked with creating a signup form for a daily scripture. I learned about formatting forms in CSS.
